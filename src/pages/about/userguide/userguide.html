            <h5>Picking Shipments</h5>

            <h6>Main Screen</h6>
            <p text-wrap>
                The main screen allows you to enter or scan a shipment number for picking.
                Once a shipment is loaded it will display summary information and two buttons:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start Picking: Will open the entry screen and allow you to start entering un-picked items for the current shipment.
                    Clicking this button will by default perform an assignment check to make sure that no other devices are currently picking the same shipment.</li>
                <li>Review Items: Will open a screen showing already picked and total quantities of items and allocations on the shipment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Clicking on the start picking button will run a check to make sure no other devices are picking the shipment and assign it to the current device.
            </p>

            <h6>Pick Entry Screen</h6>
            <p>The entry screen provides three tabs:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Enter: Unpicked item entry</li>
                <li>
                    Unpicked: Displays all remaining items, grouped by location and ordered by pick sequence.
                    It does not include quantities that have already been picked.
                    To see all items, use the Review Items button on the main screen.
                </li>
                <li>Pending: Displays pending items that have been entered but not committed.
            </ol>
            <p>
                To pick items, start by scanning or entering a bin location, then scan items as you take them from the shelf.
                You can also click on an item in the picklist to load it into the entry form.
                If you scan a different product, location or press the commit button, the currently entered item gets automatically added onto the pending list.
                To update the location you can scan another location barcode at any time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pressing the arrow buttons will allow you to move between the items remaining on the pick list and display the suggested (allocation) values in the left hand column.
                If you scan a location that is different to what is allocated you will be prompted to confirm the change.
                If you over-pick an allocation, the quantities of the other allocations will be reduced in the order in which they appear on the pick list.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clicking on an item in the pending list will allow you to update it's quantity and
                Once you have picked all items click on the commit picks button to finalise the process.
                In Acumatica, this adjusts any allocations you have altered, sets the picked quantity field and changes the pick status to partially picked or picked.

            <h5>Transferring Inventory</h5>

            <p>
                The transfer function allows you to transfer stock between locations (bins) in the same warehouse.
                It's best used for transferring a lot of items from a single location to 1 or more destination locations.
                The screen has 2 tabs, entry and pending, the latter of which lists entered items that have not been committed.
                To transfer items use the following steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Scan (or enter) the "from bin".</li>
                <li>Physically take the stock to the destination location.</li>
                <li>Scan the "to bin"</li>
                <li>Scan or each item as you are putting them in the destination location. When you scan a new item, the currently entered item is added onto the pending list.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                If you make a mistake, you can edit the quantity on the entry screen or by clicking on the item in the pending list.
                Once you have entered all items, click on the commit button to submit the transfer.
            </p>
            <p>
                By default transfers are released when submitted,
                but you can easily change this option on the fly from the transfer screen context menu in the top right hand corner.
                This can be helpful if you would like to review the transfer in Acumatica before releasing.

            <p>
                To start enter a shipment (transfer or receipt), transfer or purchase order number.
                When successfully loaded, the screen shows summary information for the loaded document, including total and already received (committed) quantities.
                Click on the add receipt button to start receiving items.
            </p>
            <h6>Entry Screen</h6>

                <li>
                    Items: Displays all items on the current document which are destined for the current warehouse.
                    The received qty displayed includes pending items.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                To receive items, start by entering or scanning an item. You can also click on an item in the items list to load it into the entry form.
                A default location will be set based on:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The location on the shipment (for the receipt shipment)</li>
                <li>The default receipt location for the item, as set on the "Item Warehouse Details" screen in Acumatica</li>
                <li>The default receipt location for the warehouse, as set on the warehouses configuration screen in Acumatica.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                <!--TODO: Check this is correct -->
                You can scan a location barcode at any time to override the receipt location for the current item.
                If you scan a different item, the currently entered item gets automatically added onto the pending list.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you make a mistake, you can edit the quantity on the entry screen or by clicking on the item in the pending list.
                Once you have entered all items, click on the commit button to submit the receipt.
            </p>
            <p>
                When receiving Purchase orders and transfer shipments, a purchase receipt document is created in Acumatica.
                If a transfer number is entered, an inventory receipt is created instead.
                For receipt shipments, if there are items that have not been received, the shipped quantity will be adjusted and the shipment confirmed.
            </p>
            <p>
                By default all receipts and purchase receipts are released when submitted,
                but you can easily change this option on the fly from the transfer screen context menu in the top right hand corner.
                This can be helpful if you would like to review the receipt in Acumatica before releasing.

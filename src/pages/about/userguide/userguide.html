            <h6>Main Screen</h6>
            <p text-wrap>
                The main screen allows you to enter or scan a shipment number for picking.
                Once a shipment is loaded it will display summary information and two buttons:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start Picking: Will open the entry screen and allow you to start entering un-picked items for the current shipment.
                    Clicking this button will by default perform an assignment check to make sure that no other devices are currently picking the same shipment.</li>
                <li>Review Items: Will open a screen showing already picked and total quantities of items and allocations on the shipment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>Entry Screen</h6>
            <p text-wrap>The entry screen provides three tabs:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Enter: Unpicked item entry</li>
                <li>Unpicked: Displays all remaining items, grouped by location and ordered by pick sequence.</li>
                <li>Pending: Displays pending items that have been entered but not committed.
            </ol>
            <p>
